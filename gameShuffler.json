Make friends with ducks, deer, and all sorts of animals as you build up a bustling community. Cook, farm, bake, and explore at a pace that's right for you.",

   "desc": "Breath of the Wild is a special game about total player freedom, getting lost, and exploration. It's a game that will test your merit and your curiosity, compelling but not demanding greatness the longer you play. It's easy to get lost in the world, drudging up hints of a world now gone while forging a new path of your own.",

   "desc": "Remade in 2019, Link's Awakening is a ground-up restylizing of one of the classic Legend of Zelda titles, and on the classic Legend of Zelda format. Complete with a measured overworld, dungeon order, special items, and locked storyline, this game is a true, modernized depiction of Zelda games less focused on freedom and more focused on delivering a specific environment for the player. In that, it very much succeeds. The atmosphere in that game is heartwarming, the aesthetic toy-like and amicable, and the story is engaging. While not my favorite title ever made, in the Legend of Zelda franchise or in the gaming world at large, Link's Awakening is absolutely worth a playthrough.",

The little farm that you manage is just the tip of the iceberg when you want to master farming, combat, shop management, family life, and all the other aspects that the wonderful world of Quill has to offer.",

The switch between graphical styles (and with it, musical fidelity) is a truly fascinating game mechanic to play with. It makes the distinct, nostalgic ambiance of this game all the more alluring. Should you be up for the test, beating this game will be rewarding. Show your skill as you collect the items to help you progress, and make your friends along the way. Completing this game in its entirety is just as much a joy as clearing the story.",

It's up to you to fulfull that dream, as slowly or quickly as you wish. Moonlighter is a ton of fun, and it'll have you equally invested in the well-being of your shop during the day... and of Will himself, crawling through procedurally-generated dungeon rooms during the night. The graphics are phenomenal, the atmosphere and aesthetic seamless, and the music phenomenal. A great game to play over and over again as a test of skill.",
