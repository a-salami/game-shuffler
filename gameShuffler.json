     "desc": "Dungeon crawl and sell it all, Moonlighter has you taking on the role of shopkeeper Will who dreams of being a hero. It's up to you to fulfull that dream, as slowly or quickly as you wish. Moonlighter is a ton of fun, and it'll have you equally invested in the well-being of your shop during the day... and of Will himself, crawling through procedurally-generated dungeon rooms during the night. The graphics are phenomenal, the atmosphere and aesthetic seamless, and the music phenomenal. A great game to play over and over again as a test of skill.",
